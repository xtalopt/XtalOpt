\section sr_saving How to save your session

XtalOpt will write a small file named xtalopt.state to its working
directory that contains the information necessary to resume the
session at a later time. The file can be rewritten manually by
clicking the "Save Session" button highlighted above, and XtalOpt will
automatically save the session every time a structure is updated.

XtalOpt will also write a file "structure.state" in each candidate
structure's directory. This file stores XtalOpt-specific information
about the structure.

\section sr_resuming How to resume your session

To resume a session, simply click "Resume stored session" (highlighted
above) and select the xtalopt.state file in the working directory of
the session you would like to resume. XtalOpt will then begin to load
the structures and search parameters. You can monitor the progress
with the progress bar that appears at the bottom of the window.

While the structures are loading, you may encounter errors that say:

\verbatim
Error, no (or not appropriate for [OPTIMIZER]) xtal data in [DIRECTORY].

This could be a result of resuming a structure that has not yet done
any local optimizations. If so, safely ignore this message.
\endverbatim

As mentioned in the message, these can typically be ignored if it only
happens for a handful of structures. This occurs when a structure has
been generated in XtalOpt, but it has not completed any geometry
optimization so there are no output files from which to load the
geometry. If it happens for a significant number of structures (or
structures that are known to have completed at least one geometry
optimization step), the output files from the optimizer may be missing
or corrupt.

After resuming a session, XtalOpt will ask if you would like to
continue the search or enter read-only mode. Read-only mode will not
generate new structures or submit geometry optimizations.

\note If you are considering resuming a read-only session, take a look
at the results.txt file in the working directory. It contains a list
of all structures, sorted by enthalpy, with additional useful
information. This can save some time when trying to locate the most
stable structure of an old search.

The working directories for XtalOpt are relocatable, meaning that the
directory containing xtalopt.state and the [gen]x[id] structure
folders may be moved, tarred, zipped, etc. and still be resumed at a
later time from a different location on the filesystem, or even a
different computer.
